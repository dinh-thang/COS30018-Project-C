Screening for all psychiatric disorders among American Indian/Alaska Native smokers may be warranted. Although these results are similar to those observed among the general U.S. population, unique risk factors exist among American Indians/Alaska Natives which may require further attention. Specific public health and clinical interventions to reduce the rate of nicotine dependence among American Indians/Alaska Natives are recommended.',\n",
